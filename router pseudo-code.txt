					we can't forward the return because we've scrubbed/not saved the sender info, so we just print to our local terminal and move on

						forward the return to the node that originally forwarded us this broadcast

					else if (we have saved routing data for the target of the broadcast):

						forward the return to the node that originall forwarded us this broadcast

			if (we haven't recorded this broadcast before and it's not a scrub request):

				record the broadcast ID and the node that forwarded it to us, so we can return it later
